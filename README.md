# userInterface
This interface lets you quickly check if you're of legal age. It features a clear title like "Enter" and two simple input fields:   Name: For your name. Age: For your age in years. After entering your details, hit the "Check" button. The result will then appear, telling you clearly if you are "of legal age" or "not yet of legal age."
